Project Abstract.

I created this repository to fulfill the PS811 Statistical Computing course requirements.

Here, I have uploaded my project that investigates the question: "What is the effect of having politically active female members in ruling families of non-democratic countries on pro-feminist policies?".

In this project, I use panel data analysis with fixed effects on the original dataset that includes all politically active female family members from countries rated as non-democratic in Polity IV dataset. I use interaction terms for postcommunism and Gender Development Index ratings from the United Nations to investigate if communist gender equality ideals and international community influence tied to aid can amplify the effect of having politically active female members in ruling families of non-democratic countries.

This project is useful to investigate the concept of descriptive representation in the context of authoritarian regimes.

Please read my PDF file for clean paper without codes produced in Latex. You can see my RMD file for all codes and software packages used for data analysis.</p>

I will appreciate any feedback on how to expand this analysis.
